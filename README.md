Nashville Housing Data Cleaning Project (SQL)

This project focuses on cleaning a housing dataset using SQL Server. The main tasks involved creating a staging table, converting sale dates to a consistent format, and filling in missing property addresses by matching Parcel IDs. The property addresses were then split into separate address and city columns using string functions. Finally, duplicate records were identified and removed using a CTE with the ROW_NUMBER() function.

The script demonstrates practical SQL techniques for preparing real-world data for analysis.
